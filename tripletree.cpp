 /**
      * Constructor that builds a TripleTree out of the given PNG.
      *
      * The TripleTree represents the subimage from (0,0) to (w-1, h-1) where
      * w-1 and h-1 are the largest valid image coordinates of the original PNG.
      * Every node corresponds to a rectangle of pixels in the original PNG,
      * represented by an (x,y) pair for the upper left corner of the
      * square and two integers for the number of pixels on the width and
      * height dimensions of the rectangular region the node defines.
      *
      * The node's three children correspond to a partition
      * of the node's rectangular region into three approximately equal-size strips.
      *
      * If the rectangular region is taller than it is wide, the region is divided
      * into horizontal strips:
      *  +-------+
      *  |   A   |
      *  |       |
      *  +-------+
      *  |   B   |
      *  |       |    (Split tall)
      *  +-------+
      *  |   C   |
      *  |       |
      *  +-------+
      *
      * If the rectangular region is wider than it is tall, the region is divided
      * into vertical strips:
      *  +---------+---------+---------+
      *  |    A    |    B    |    C    |
      *  |         |         |         |    (Split wide)
      *  +---------+---------+---------+
      *
      * Your regions are not guaranteed to have dimensions exactly divisible by 3.
      * If the dimensions of your rectangular region are 3p x q or q x 3p where 3p
      * represents the length of the long side, then your rectangular regions will
      * each have dimensions p x q (or q x p)
      *
      * If the dimensions are (3p+1) x q, subregion B gets the extra pixel of size
      * while subregions A and C have dimensions p x q.
      *
      * If the dimensions are (3p+2) x q, subregions A and C each get an extra pixel
      * of size, while subregion B has dimensions p x q.
      *
      * If the region to be divided is a square, then apply the Split wide behaviour.
      *
      * Every leaf in the constructed tree corresponds to a pixel in the PNG.
      *
      * @param imIn - the input image used to construct the tree
